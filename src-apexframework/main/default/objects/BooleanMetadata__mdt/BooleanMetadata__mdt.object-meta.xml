    <description>This is intended as a backwards compatible replacement for BooleanSettings that can be pushed as part of a package for better release management.   If a BooleanMetadata is defined, we will check for a field in BooleanHierarchy__c with the same developer name.  This allows any custom setting to be overwritten per user, role, or profile in the hierarchy.</description>
