# Unmanaged Package Instructions

Another way to install this framework is an an unmanaged package.   We have some scripts to make it easy.  Most of the time it is just issuing the command:

```./scripts/bash/mdapi-deploy ApexFramework -u <org>```

Where <org> is the name for the login name or alias for the org you wish to install to.
